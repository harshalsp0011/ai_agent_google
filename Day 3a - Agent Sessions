It's one of the most impactful areas where AI is making a tangible difference. Here are some of the key trends and recent advancements:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **De Novo Design:** This is a huge area. Instead of screening existing libraries of compounds, generative AI models (like Variational Autoencoders - VAEs, Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs, and more recently, transformer-based models similar to those used in LLMs) are now capable of *designing entirely new molecules* from scratch. These models learn the complex rules of chemistry and molecular properties and can then generate molecules with desired characteristics (e.g., binding to a specific protein target, good solubility, low toxicity).\n*   **Tailored Properties:** Companies are using these generative models to create molecules optimized for specific therapeutic targets and patient populations, moving beyond just finding a \"hit\" to designing a \"best-in-class\" drug.\n\n**2. Predicting Molecular Properties and Interactions:**\n\n*   **Binding Affinity Prediction:** AI models are becoming incredibly adept at predicting how strongly a potential drug molecule will bind to its target protein. This drastically reduces the need for expensive and time-consuming lab experiments.\n*   **ADMET Prediction (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity):** Predicting how a drug will behave in the body (pharmacokinetics) and whether it will be toxic is crucial. AI is significantly improving the accuracy of these predictions early in the discovery process, helping to weed out unpromising candidates sooner.\n*   **Off-Target Effects:** AI can help identify potential unintended interactions with other biological molecules, which could lead to side effects.\n\n**3. Accelerating Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Genomics and Proteomics Analysis:** AI can sift through massive datasets of genetic and protein information to identify novel disease targets that were previously unknown or too complex to analyze manually.\n*   **Understanding Disease Pathways:** By analyzing complex biological networks, AI can help researchers understand the underlying mechanisms of diseases and pinpoint key intervention points.\n\n**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze existing drug databases and compare their molecular structures and known effects with disease profiles to identify drugs that could be repurposed for new indications. This can be a much faster and cheaper route to new treatments.\n\n**5. Optimizing Clinical Trial Design and Analysis:**\n\n*   **Patient Stratification:** AI can help identify patient subgroups most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more efficient and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** AI models can analyze early-stage trial data to predict the likelihood of success in later phases.\n\n**Examples of Companies and Their Work (general trends, not specific news announcements):**\n\n*   **BenevolentAI:** Uses AI to analyze scientific literature and clinical data to identify new drug targets and accelerate drug development.\n*   **Exscientia:** Focuses on using AI to design novel drug candidates with specific properties.\n*   **Atomwise:** Employs deep learning for structure-based drug discovery, predicting how small molecules will bind to proteins.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** A prominent player in generative AI for drug discovery, known for its end-to-end AI platform.\n*   **NVIDIA:** While a hardware company, their GPUs are essential for training AI models in drug discovery, and they offer platforms and tools to aid researchers.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   **Speed and Efficiency:** AI is drastically shortening the timelines for drug discovery, which traditionally can take over a decade and cost billions.\n*   **Precision and Novelty:** AI enables the design of highly specific molecules and the exploration of novel therapeutic avenues.\n*   **Reduced Failure Rates:** By improving predictions early on, AI helps reduce the high failure rates seen in drug development.\n\nThe field is still maturing, and there are ongoing challenges like data quality, model interpretability, and regulatory hurdles. However, the pace of innovation is incredible, and AI is undoubtedly transforming the landscape of pharmaceutical research and development.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned in the context of AI in drug discovery: **Predicting Molecular Properties and Interactions.** This is a critical area because it helps researchers understand how a potential drug will behave *before* it's synthesized and tested in costly and time-consuming laboratory experiments.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into this development:\n\n**What does \"Predicting Molecular Properties and Interactions\" actually mean?**\n\nIt refers to using AI models to forecast various characteristics of a potential drug molecule, including:\n\n*   **Binding Affinity:** This is perhaps the most fundamental prediction. It's about how strongly a drug molecule will attach itself to its intended biological target (usually a protein or enzyme involved in a disease). A strong binding affinity is often correlated with a drug's effectiveness.\n*   **Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD):**\n    *   **Absorption:** How well will the drug be absorbed into the bloodstream (e.g., if taken orally)?\n    *   **Distribution:** Where will the drug go in the body? Will it reach the target tissue effectively?\n    *   **Metabolism:** How will the body break down the drug? Are the byproducts safe?\n    *   **Excretion:** How will the drug and its metabolites be eliminated from the body?\n    *   **Pharmacodynamics (PD):** What is the drug's effect on the body once it reaches its target? This is about the mechanism of action and the resulting physiological response.\n*   **Toxicity and Side Effects:** Predicting whether a drug will cause harmful effects. This is often broken down into:\n    *   **General Toxicity:** Will it damage major organs like the liver or kidneys?\n    *   **Specific Toxicities:** For example, will it cause cardiac issues (hERG channel blockage) or genotoxicity (damage to DNA)?\n    *   **Off-Target Effects:** Will the drug bind to unintended targets in the body, leading to unwanted side effects?\n*   **Solubility:** How well will the drug dissolve in water or other biological fluids? This is crucial for formulation and absorption.\n*   **Stability:** How stable is the molecule under different conditions (e.g., temperature, pH)?\n\n**How is AI used for these predictions?**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding complex patterns in large datasets. In this context, the datasets consist of:\n\n1.  **Chemical Structures:** Databases of millions of known molecules.\n2.  **Biological Assays:** Results from experiments that measure binding affinity, toxicity, metabolic rates, etc., for these molecules.\n3.  **Protein Structures:** Information about the 3D shapes of target proteins.\n4.  **Genomic and Proteomic Data:** Information about the biological systems themselves.\n\nAI models (like Graph Neural Networks - GNNs, Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs, and transformers) learn the relationships between a molecule's structure and its properties based on this historical data.\n\n*   **For Binding Affinity:** Models can learn the intricate ways a molecule interacts with the 3D structure of a target protein, predicting how well they fit together and the strength of their interaction.\n*   **For ADMET/Toxicity:** Models analyze the chemical features of a molecule that are known to be associated with good or bad absorption, metabolism, or toxicity. For example, certain functional groups might be flagged as potentially toxic.\n*   **For Solubility:** Models learn how the physical and chemical properties of a molecule (like its polarity, size, and the presence of certain functional groups) influence its solubility.\n\n**Why is this development so significant?**\n\n*   **Reduces Experimental Burden:** Before AI, researchers had to synthesize and test thousands, sometimes millions, of compounds in the lab. AI can prioritize which compounds are most promising, saving immense amounts of time, resources, and money.\n*   **Faster Drug Development Cycles:** By identifying potential issues early, AI helps avoid costly late-stage failures. A drug candidate predicted to be toxic or ineffective can be discarded much earlier in the process.\n*   **Improves Drug \"Druggability\":** AI helps design molecules that are not only effective but also have favorable pharmacological properties, making them more likely to become successful drugs.\n*   **Enables \"Design for Safety\":** By predicting potential toxicities, AI allows researchers to proactively design molecules to be safer from the outset.\n*   **Uncovers Non-Obvious Relationships:** AI can identify subtle correlations between molecular structure and biological outcomes that human researchers might miss.\n\nIn essence, predicting molecular properties and interactions allows AI to act as an incredibly powerful, virtual laboratory assistant, guiding drug discovery efforts towards the most viable candidates.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Several types of companies are heavily involved in leveraging AI for predicting molecular properties and interactions in drug discovery.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
